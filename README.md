<h1>Simulation-of-Smart-Home-Automation</h1>
This project focuses on how different devices within a Smart house such as IoT devices, sensors communicate with each other. We have tried to simulate for 4 different houses namely veda house, joel house, shenthan house, bhargav house.



The subnets used for each house are: <br/>
Veda House adopts the subnet 172.17.68.1/26 <br/>
Shenthan House adopts 172.17.68.65/26 <br/>
Joel House adopts 172.17.68.129/26 <br/>
Bhargav House adopts 172.17.68.203/26.

The project mandates static IP address assignment, foregoing DHCP, for all devices.
Additionally, SSH is configured on routers for remote login, fostering secure
monitoring and control.This comprehensive approach aims to create a secure,
interconnected smart home ecosystem across the four houses with statically
assigned IP addresses for enhanced control and monitoring.

This is how a single house would look like:
